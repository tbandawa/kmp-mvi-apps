    "description": "<p>The domestic scenes, portraits, and nudes painted by John Currin have been called “American grotesque,” as unsettling as they are meticulously rendered. <em>Stamford after Brunch</em> captures the giddy camaraderie of three women with soft, childlike arms and improbably scrawny,  angular legs. While the figures  laugh, drink martinis, and smoke cigars, the winter landscape outside stands in acute contrast to the interior comforts of warm conversation and lightweight clothing. The three women, near caricatures, represent the artist’s principal gallerists at the time (Sadie Coles, Andrea Rosen, and Shaun Regen) visiting Currin’s Connecticut home.<p>\n",
